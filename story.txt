However, there was no Tommy in the front yard. 

"Tommy?"

Tommy was a leaf. He was blowing down the street with the rest of his play-mates.

# 1) 

It was a windy day. 

The mailman barely made it to the front door. When the door opened, Mrs. Pennington said, "hello", but, before she had a real chance to say "thank you", the mail blew out of the mailman's hands, into the house and the front door slammed in his face. Mrs. Pennington ran to pick up the mail.

"Oh my," she said.

"There," she said. "it will be safe until we get home."

Tommy smiled, ran to the car and got in. He rolled down the back window and looked up into the sky. He wondered where the old leaf had gone. Perhaps one day he would see what the old leaf had seen perhaps.

Tommy was watching the shutters open and then shut, open and then shut.

"Mom", he said, "may I got outside?"

"Be careful", she said. "It's so windy today."

"Hey", he called out, "the sights up here. They are spectacular. Come and see."

Tommy and the maple leaf ignored him. 

"I see something. I see the dump". The old leaf cried out. "I see smoke. Come up here. I see fire."

"I see nothing", the maple leaf said. 


[5] Mrs. Pennington came to the front porch.
"Tommy, I have your jacket. Please put it on"

[?] Tommy watched in fascination.

"If I was a leaf, I would fly clear across the world," Tommy thought and then ran out into the yard among th swirl of colors.


[14] Tommy saw the fence that surrounded the city dump. He was happy to be with his friend/ THey would have fun in the dump.

Suddenly, a car pulled up. It was Tommy's mom. Mrs. Pennington wasn't about to let her little boy run into the city dump.

"if the wind blows you in that direction," the old leaf said "you will end up in the city dump."
"I don't want that," Tommy said.
"If you are blown in that direction, you will fly high into the air andsee things that no leaf has seen before."
"Follow me to the city dump," the maple leaf said. "Most of my friends are there."


"Where do you think we are going?" Tommy asked the leaf.
"Does it matter?" the leaf resplied. "Have fun. Life is short."
"I beg to differ," an older leaf said suddenly coming beside them. "The journey may be short, but the end is the beginning."
Tommy pondered this the best a leaf could ponder.
"Where do we end up?"
